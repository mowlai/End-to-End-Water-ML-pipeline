# 💧 Water Data Science Workshop: From Sensor to Prediction

Welcome to the official repository for the **Water Data Science Workshop**, a two-day intensive course designed for graduate students and early-career professionals interested in applying machine learning (ML) to ultrafiltration (UF) water treatment systems.

This repo contains:
- 📁 Sample UF sensor and weather datasets
- 📓 Jupyter Notebooks for code demonstrations
- 🖼️ Slide decks (coming soon)
- 🧪 Functional feature extraction scripts
- 📊 Dashboard and model deployment examples

---

## 🧠 Workshop Objectives

- Understand the structure and function of UF water treatment systems and their sensor data
- Learn to collect and integrate data from PLC/SCADA and weather APIs
- Engineer features like TMP slope, Net Water Production (NWP), and BW efficiency
- Apply supervised (Random Forest, Neural Networks) and unsupervised (K-Means) learning
- Build dashboards using Grafana and deploy ML models for real-time monitoring
